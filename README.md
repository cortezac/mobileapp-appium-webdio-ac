**Automated Mobile Application Testing with Appium & WebdriverIO**

This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a robust test automation suite for a mobile application built with the Flutter framework. The suite leverages Appium and WebdriverIO to effectively validate various functionalities across Android and iOS platforms, guaranteeing a consistent and positive user experience.

For enhanced cross-platform compatibility, this test suite strategically utilizes accessibility IDs as locators. This approach ensures the tests function reliably on both Android and iOS devices.
